# Problem

You all must have seen a seven segment display.

Alice got a number written in **seven segment format** where each segment was created used a matchstick.

Example: If Alice gets a number **123** so basically Alice used **12 matchsticks** for this number.

Alice is wondering what is the numerically largest value that she can generate by using **at most** the matchsticks that she currently possess.Help Alice out by telling her that number.

## Input Format

First line contains **T** (test cases).

Next **T** lines contain a number **N**.

## Output Format:

Print the **largest** possible number **numerically** that can be generated using **at max** that many number of matchsticks which was used to generate N.

**Constraints**:

```
1 ≤ T ≤ 100

1 ≤ length ≤ 100
```

| Sample input | Sample output |
|---|---|
| 2 | 1 |
| 1 | 111 |
| 0 |  |
